You may share any challenge(s) you face while finishing the assignment and how you overcome the challenge.

*/

/*
1. I could not figure out how to nest avg(Salary of a specific department) in one command line.
I tried to google on stackoverflow but nothing came out of it.
It would be very useful if we could store it in a global variable and use it in more than 1 execution.
Overall, it's pretty tricky

2. I tried to use charindex and substring to find the character '.' to partition Name.
It kept returning the position of '.' as 0.
Turns out it was ','. It's just too hard to see.
